# Availity’s Fullstack Homework Assignment 
 
### 1.Tell me about your proudest professional achievement.  It can also be a personal or school project. 

* While working at my current project Peloton, we were working on a new application. Now during the deployment we want to follow the CI/CD and create a pipeline that can check our code coverage, run a few sanity test cases etc. But due to the absence of our devops guy we were lacking. So i decided to step up and create the pipeline as per the company standard, basically I worked as a developer and devops both to make sure our application is deployed successfully. It’s not something extraordinary but I am very proud of this moment and everyone around acknowledged the same too.


### 2. Tell me about something you have read recently that you would recommend and why. (Can be a Github Repo, Article, Blog, Book, etc)

* I recently read a book named Enterprise, Integration Patterns. It's a good book if you want to understand how various enterprise applications can connect with each other in a better way. Following these patterns help us to implement solutions which are already tested and help us create a better solution. So this book is old but still holds true for the cloud based approach. So it’s a good read.

### 3. How would you explain what Availity does to your grandmother?

* Availity is a portal which lets healthcare workers track patients, check ins, tracks their billing etc. 
Healthcare workers are already occupied with so many other tasks so it would be very easy if they can have a system that can track bills, claims and patients, etc. 
Availity is a portal which does that for Healthcare workers, helping them to be the best they can at their work. Healthcare workers use various tools provided by the Availity to manage status of claims, check the eligibility of an individual and see all the data on a dashboard. Now every hospital has lots of data in order to make it easy to understand they provide various reporting tools. So Availity makes the life of healthcare workers stress free and helps them in doing what they do best.

### 4.Coding exercise: You are tasked to write a checker that validates the parentheses of a LISP code.  Write a program (in Java or JavaScript) which takes in a string as an input and returns true if all the parentheses in the string are properly closed and nested.

* Solution is implemented and is available in solution 4 folder

### 5.Coding exercise:   For frontend engineer: Healthcare providers request to be part of the Availity system.  Using a modern JavaScript framework (React preferred, or Vue or Angular), create a registration user interface so healthcare providers can electronically join Availity.  The following data points should be collected:
- Last Name
- NPI number
- Business Address
- Telephone Number
- Email address

* Solution is implemented and is available in solution 5 folder, along with readme. 

### 6. Coding exercise:  Availity receives enrollment files from various benefits management and enrollment solutions (I.e. HR platforms, payroll platforms).  Most of these files are typically in EDI format.  However, there are some files in CSV format.  For the files in CSV format, write a program that will read the content of the file and separate enrollees by insurance company in its own file. Additionally, sort the contents of each file by last and first name (ascending).  Lastly, if there are duplicate User Ids for the same Insurance Company, then only the record with the highest version should be included. The following data points are included in the file:
- User Id (string)
- First Name (string)
- Last Name (string)
- Version (integer)
- Insurance Company (string)

* Solution is implemented and is available in solution 6 folder, along with readme.
